hamachi-0.9.9.9-linux (nokia-770)
=================================

Hamachi is a zero-configuration virtual private networking tool.

	http://hamachi.cc

Quick Start

	Run './install' and then 'tuncfg' from under the root account

	Run 'hamachi-init' to generate crypto identity (any account).

	Run 'hamachi start' to launch Hamachi daemon.

	Run 'hamachi login' to put the daemon online and to create an account.

	Run 'hamachi join <network>' to join the network.

	Run 'hamachi go-online <network>' to go online in the network.

	Run 'hamachi list' to list network members and their status.

Requirements & Privileged Access

	Hamachi requires TUN/TAP device driver to create and manage virtual
	network interface. If you have /dev/net/tun file, you are all set. 
	Otherwise visit the following page for more information -

		http://hamachi.cc/tuntap

	Unless you are planning to use Hamachi exclusively from under the
	root account, you will need to run 'tuncfg' daemon. This daemon
	encapsulates all root-level functionality required by Hamachi and
	it must be running prior to launching Hamachi itself.

	Tuncfg is distributed in a source code under the BSD license. You 
	can find the source code in ./tuncfg directory of this distribution.
	
	Running 'make install' automatically builds tuncfg and installs it
	in /sbin folder. If you would prefer to install it in altervative
	directory, modify ./Makefile accordingly.

Installation

	Hamachi Linux client comes as a single executable binary (hamachi)
	compiled for the platform of your choice. This binary includes the 
	daemon, the control application and the setup utility.

	To install hamachi in /usr/bin run the following command from under
	the root account

		./install

	Once installed you must run 'tuncfg' daemon with root privileges -

		sudo /sbin/tuncfg

	or if you don't have sudo -

		su - ; /sbin/tuncfg; exit

	Hamachi requires one time initialization (per Linux user account).
	This step generates cryptographic key pair and creates ~/.hamachi 
	directory where Hamachi stores the keys, the configuration and the 
	state. To perform this initialization run

		./hamachi-init

Running Hamachi

	Running Hamachi involves starting it as a background process and 
	then controlling this process from the command line. To launch 
	Hamachi daemon run -

		./hamachi start

	To stop the daemon run -

		./hamachi stop

	Running hamachi without an argument displays daemon's status -

		version  : hamachi-lnx-0.9.9.9
		pid      : 956
		status   : logging in
		nickname : buddy

	When run for the first time the daemon stays offline. To bring
	it online run -

		./hamachi login

	To bring it back offline use -

		./hamachi logout

	Note that the daemon remembers its state when it is shutdown with
	'stop' command. So if its state was online, it will automatically
	go online when started next time. If it was offline, it will stay
	offline.
	
Network Operations

	Once logged in, you can join the networks using 'hamachi join'
	command. You will be prompted for the password if it is required. 

	You may also create your own networks using 'hamachi create'. You
	will become an owner of any networks that you create and only you
	will be able to destroy these networks with 'hamachi delete' command.
	
	With 'hamachi evict' you can remove unwanted members from the networks
	that you own.
	
	Note that you will stay offline in the network after you create or
	join it. To go online in the network use 'hamachi go-online' command.

	Two other commands 'hamachi go-offline' and 'hamachi leave' reverse
	the effect of the first two.

	Note again that the daemon remembers your network state. If you 
	logout or shutdown the daemon while being online in a network, the 
	daemon will automatically put you back online in it on the next logon.
	
Listing Peers

	To view the list of all networks and their members run -

		./hamachi list

	Network names are enclosed in square brakets. The asterisk (*) in
	front of the network name means that you are online in this network.

		* [homelan]
		     * 5.0.0.15
		     x 5.0.0.16        ronny
		       5.0.0.17        bubba
		     * 5.0.0.18        zhopa      10.0.0.100:45634
      
	Underneath the network there is a peer list. Online peers will have
	their IP address prefixed by an asterisk (*) or an (x). 

	(*) means that the tunnel to the peer is either being established or
	    ready. In latter case, peer's tunnel address will be shown on the 
	    right side of the list.

	(x) means that the peer in unreachable, ie the mediation server failed
	    to establish p2p tunnel between you and the peer.
	
	If peer's nickname is known, it will be shown too. To retrieve peers'
	nicks use 'hamachi get-nicks' command.

Miscellaneous

	You can also change your own nick by using 'hamachi set-nick' command.
	If you are online, the change will occur immediately. Otherwise new
	nick will be remembered and the change will occur at the next login.
