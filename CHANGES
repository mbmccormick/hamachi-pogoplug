Change log for Hamachi/Linux client.
Started with version 0.9.9.9-8

== 0.9.9.9-20 ==

* Fixed a bug causing the daemon to segfault in the event of
  some peer going offline.

== 0.9.9.9-17 ==

* Fixed link layer framing of de-tunneled IP multicast packets. 
  Previously destination address was incorrectly set to host's
  MAC instead of 01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx.

== 0.9.9.9-16 ==

* Fixed a bug in a tunneling code that under certain conditions
  caused daemon to die with SIGABRT when transferring large
  amounts of data.

== 0.9.9.9-15 ==

* Fixed a bug causing the daemon to behave erratically under certain
  conditions over slow/lossy links

* Modified hamachi-init to set an access mask for private key to 0400
  and to 0444 for public key

== 0.9.9.9-14 ==

* Fixed a bug that caused Hamachi daemon to terminate unexpectedly
  when more than one 'hamachi login' commands were issued in a rapid
  succession.

== 0.9.9.9-13 ==

* Added support for tunneling routed packets, ie packets that are not
  destined to peer's 5.x.x.x address. This is *very* powerful feature.
  
  Consider for example two separate LANs both connected to the I-net.
  One LAN is 10.1.1.0/24, another - 10.2.2.0/24 and their default 
  gateways are running Hamachi clients with 5.1.1.1 and 5.2.2.2 IPs
  respectively.

  Adding the following routes -

    ip route 10.2.2.0/24 via 5.2.2.2 dev ham 0  (on LAN1 gateway)
    ip route 10.1.1.0/24 via 5.1.1.1 dev ham 0  (on LAN2 gateway)

  will enable LAN-to-LAN communications via Hamachi tunnel that exists
  between the gateways.

== 0.9.9.9-12 ==

* Modified command-line portion of Hamachi to cope gracefully with
  redirects. v11 was errorneously treatin redirects as login failures
  and produced confusing console message.

== 0.9.9.9-11 ==

* Added support for 'redirect' message, which is required to connect
  to the next-gen Hamachi backend servers

== 0.9.9.9-10 ==

* Increased acceted size of network passwords from 63 to 255 characters

* Added 'hamachi evict' command

* Added rudimental shaping of p2p traffic. Both TX and RX UDP transmission
  rates can now be capped. Define the following values in ~/.hamachi/config

  	TxRate <rate in bytes per second>
	RxRate <rate in bytes per second>

  This caps are applied to tunneled IPv4 traffic only, and they are applied
  globally (ie not on per-tunnel basis). For example -

  	TxRate 8192

  will restrict outbound packet rate to 8 KB/s. 

== 0.9.9.9-9 ==

* this release was skipped

== 0.9.9.9-8 ==

* Added an option of keep-aliving tunnels. When enabled, it will cause
  Hamachi to send out small UDP packet over the tunnel if there was no
  outbound traffic for a specified number of seconds. Default value is
  90 seconds.

  To modify the value add the following line into ~/.hamachi/config:

  	KeepAlive 123

  where 123 is an idle timeout in seconds. Minimum allowed values is 10.

  To disable tunnel keep-alives, set KeepAlive to 0.

* Rebuilt -pentium package as previous version (0.9.9.9-7) was statically
  linked against non-pentium libcrypto library.
